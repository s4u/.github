### New releases

After `PR` accept we will release new version in the month, in more case early.

### Good practices for `PR`

- one `PR` - one commit - so please squash all if required
- one `PR` - one feature - so if changes are independent please create many `PR`
- after review with change request please answer in 14 days

## Developer tools :hammer_and_wrench:

Most of our projects use [sonarcloud](https://sonarcloud.io/organizations/simplify4u/)
to analyze code quality, please log in on it using GitHub account.

You can install and configure [sonarlint](https://www.sonarlint.org/) in your IDE to detect some code quality issue
early.

We use GitHub Action - so please look at result for automatic code building.
